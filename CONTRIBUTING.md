# How to contribute

- Clone the project

```
git clone https://github.com/pkovzz/ngx-otp-input.git
```

- Install npm dependencies

```
npm install
```

- First, build the library. Run one of these commands:
  - `npm build-lib` - this will build the library once
  - `npm watch-lib` - this will be watching for file changes during the development, and re-build the library on every change.

```
npm run watch-lib
```

- Build the demo app against the library

```
npm run start
```

or

```
ng serve
```

- Make changes under `projects/ngx-otp-input/src/`

  - or if you want to make changes in the demo app, then `src/`

- Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) when writing commit messages
